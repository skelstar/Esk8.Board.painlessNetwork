# Esk8.Board.painlessNetwork
Trialed this (on the bench):
- got mesh working with multiple nodes
- sometimes the delays are small (<50ms) and acceptable, but most of the time the delays are not small (>100ms)

This would be useful for peripherals rather than critical remote-> motor controller links
